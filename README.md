To enhance customer satisfaction and achieve operational excellence by automating recurring and manual processes with the help of SQL and Machine Learning,

### **Use Case: Automating Refund Processing**
**Problem:**
Refund processing in e-commerce often involves:
- Manually identifying eligible transactions.
- Validating refund requests against policies (e.g., return timeframe, product condition).
- Communicating with customers for missing details.
- Processing refunds through the payment gateway.

These tasks, if done manually, are time-consuming, prone to errors, and lead to customer dissatisfaction due to delays.

**Solution: Automating Refund Processing Using SQL and Machine Learning**
1. **Data Extraction with SQL:**
   - Use SQL to extract customer order data, including purchase date, product return status, and payment details.
   - Create a query to identify transactions eligible for refunds (e.g., "Orders placed within 30 days with a valid return request").

2. **ML Model for Validation:**
   - Develop a machine learning model to predict refund eligibility based on historical data, factoring in variables like:
     - Return reasons (e.g., "Damaged," "Wrong item shipped").
     - Fraud detection (e.g., identifying patterns of misuse by customers).
   - The model flags anomalies or requests needing manual review.

3. **Workflow Automation:**
   - Integrate an automated workflow to:
     - Notify the customer about their refund status.
     - Initiate payment gateway refund processing for straightforward cases.
     - Assign complex cases to human agents with all necessary details pre-fetched.

4. **Efficiency Tracking:**
   - Use dashboards (e.g., built with SQL-based BI tools) to monitor:
     - Number of refunds processed automatically.
     - Average time saved per refund.
     - Customer satisfaction metrics (e.g., survey scores post-refund).

---

**Outcome:**
- **Efficiency:** Automates 80% of refunds, saving hours of manual effort daily.
- **Accuracy:** Reduces errors in refund processing.
- **Experience:** Provides faster responses and resolution to customers.

### **Expected Output**

Given the mock `historical_refund_data.csv` and `new_refund_requests.csv` data, the model will classify the new refund requests into the following categories:

#### **Auto-Approved Refunds**

| order_id | customer_id | purchase_amount | return_reason_code | customer_return_rate | refund_approved |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 101      | C001        | 60.0            | 1                  | 0.04                 | 1               |
| 104      | C004        | 35.0            | 4                  | 0.01                 | 1               |

#### **Flagged Refunds**

| order_id | customer_id | purchase_amount | return_reason_code | customer_return_rate | refund_approved |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 102      | C002        | 180.0           | 3                  | 0.12                 | 0               |
| 103      | C003        | 220.0           | 2                  | 0.22                 | 0               |
| 105      | C005        | 90.0            | 3                  | 0.16                 | 0               |
