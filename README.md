To enhance customer satisfaction and achieve operational excellence by automating recurring and manual processes with the help of SQL and Machine Learning,

### **Use Case: Automating Refund Processing**
**Problem:**
Refund processing in e-commerce often involves:
- Manually identifying eligible transactions.
- Validating refund requests against policies (e.g., return timeframe, product condition).
- Communicating with customers for missing details.
- Processing refunds through the payment gateway.

These tasks, if done manually, are time-consuming, prone to errors, and lead to customer dissatisfaction due to delays.

---

**Solution: Automating Refund Processing Using SQL and Machine Learning**
1. **Data Extraction with SQL:**
   - Use SQL to extract customer order data, including purchase date, product return status, and payment details.
   - Create a query to identify transactions eligible for refunds (e.g., "Orders placed within 30 days with a valid return request").

2. **ML Model for Validation:**
   - Develop a machine learning model to predict refund eligibility based on historical data, factoring in variables like:
     - Return reasons (e.g., "Damaged," "Wrong item shipped").
     - Fraud detection (e.g., identifying patterns of misuse by customers).
   - The model flags anomalies or requests needing manual review.

3. **Workflow Automation:**
   - Integrate an automated workflow to:
     - Notify the customer about their refund status.
     - Initiate payment gateway refund processing for straightforward cases.
     - Assign complex cases to human agents with all necessary details pre-fetched.

4. **Efficiency Tracking:**
   - Use dashboards (e.g., built with SQL-based BI tools) to monitor:
     - Number of refunds processed automatically.
     - Average time saved per refund.
     - Customer satisfaction metrics (e.g., survey scores post-refund).

---

**Outcome:**
- **Efficiency:** Automates 80% of refunds, saving hours of manual effort daily.
- **Accuracy:** Reduces errors in refund processing.
- **Experience:** Provides faster responses and resolution to customers.

### **Step 1: Extract Data Using SQL**
First, identify eligible transactions using an SQL query:

```sql
-- Identify orders eligible for refund
SELECT 
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    purchase_date,
    return_status,
    reason_code
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    return_status = 'Requested'
    AND DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), purchase_date) <= 30;
```

This query retrieves orders with refund requests made within 30 days of purchase.

### **Step 2: Train a Machine Learning Model for Refund Eligibility**
Use historical data to train a model to classify whether a refund request is likely valid or requires manual review.

#### Data Preprocessing (Python):
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load historical refund data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_refund_data.csv')

# Features and target
X = data[['purchase_amount', 'return_reason_code', 'customer_return_rate']]
y = data['refund_approved']

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test accuracy
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
```

---

### **Step 3: Automate Workflow**
Use the model to predict refund approval for new requests:

#### Predict Refunds:
```python
# Load new requests extracted using the SQL query
new_requests = pd.read_csv('new_refund_requests.csv')

# Predict refund approval
new_requests['refund_approved'] = model.predict(new_requests[['purchase_amount', 'return_reason_code', 'customer_return_rate']])

# Separate auto-approved and flagged requests
auto_approved = new_requests[new_requests['refund_approved'] == 1]
flagged = new_requests[new_requests['refund_approved'] == 0]

# Save results
auto_approved.to_csv('auto_approved_refunds.csv', index=False)
flagged.to_csv('flagged_refunds.csv', index=False)
```

---

### **Step 4: Integrate Workflow Automation**
Using an automation tool or script, notify customers and process refunds for auto-approved cases while escalating flagged requests.

#### Notify Customers:
```python
for index, row in auto_approved.iterrows():
    print(f"Sending approval email to customer {row['customer_id']} for order {row['order_id']}")
    # Add email API integration here
```

#### Escalate Flagged Requests:
```python
for index, row in flagged.iterrows():
    print(f"Escalating refund request for manual review: Order {row['order_id']}")
    # Add manual review system integration here
```

---

### **Expected Output**

Given the mock `historical_refund_data.csv` and `new_refund_requests.csv` data, the model will classify the new refund requests into the following categories:

#### **Auto-Approved Refunds**

| order_id | customer_id | purchase_amount | return_reason_code | customer_return_rate | refund_approved |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 101      | C001        | 60.0            | 1                  | 0.04                 | 1               |
| 104      | C004        | 35.0            | 4                  | 0.01                 | 1               |

#### **Flagged Refunds**

| order_id | customer_id | purchase_amount | return_reason_code | customer_return_rate | refund_approved |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 102      | C002        | 180.0           | 3                  | 0.12                 | 0               |
| 103      | C003        | 220.0           | 2                  | 0.22                 | 0               |
| 105      | C005        | 90.0            | 3                  | 0.16                 | 0               |
